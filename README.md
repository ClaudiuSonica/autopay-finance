## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to present a fictitious Web3 Auto Pay Service through an engaging and visually appealing landing page. The central objective was to effectively leverage React, SCSS, and Atomic Design principles to craft a cohesive user interface.

## Technologies and Methodologies

### Technologies Used

- **React:** The landing page is constructed as a single-page application using React components, facilitating component reusability and efficient UI updates.

- **SCSS (Sass):** Styling is achieved using SCSS, a robust CSS preprocessor that allows for cleaner and more maintainable styles through variables, mixins, and nesting.

### Methodologies Highlighted

- **Atomic Design:** The project was developed following Atomic Design principles, which emphasize structuring components into atomic units: atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, and pages. This encourages reusability and maintainability.

## Atomic Design Implementation

The landing page's components and structure adhere to the Atomic Design methodology:

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── atoms/
│   │   ├── Logo.jsx
│   │   ├── Nav.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── molecules/
│   │   ├── Banner.jsx
│   │   ├── Card.jsx
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── organisms/
│   │   ├── Header.js
│   │   ├── FeatureSection.js
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── templates/
│   │   ├── LandingPageTemplate.js
│   │   └── ...
│   └── pages/
│       ├── LandingPage.js
│       └── ...
├── styles/
│   ├── _variables.scss
│   ├── _mixins.scss
│   ├── _global.scss
│   └── ...
├── App.jsx
└── index.jsx
```

- **Atoms:** Basic building blocks like buttons and icons.
- **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms to form small functional units like feature cards.
- **Organisms:** Complex UI components that consist of molecules and/or atoms, such as headers and feature sections.
- **Templates:** Organisms arranged within a layout to create complete sections of a page.
- **Pages:** Final content pages composed of templates and components.

## Conclusion

The development of the Web3 Auto Pay Service landing page showcased my adeptness with React, SCSS, and the implementation of Atomic Design principles. The organized folder structure, adherence to component hierarchies, and the seamless integration of design elements demonstrate my proficiency in creating an engaging and visually appealing user interface. For a deeper understanding of my skills, I invite you to explore the codebase and its implementation.
